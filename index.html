            <h2 class="title is-4">What is OFDM?</h2>
    
        <p><span style="color:#000000;">OFDM stands for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing which is a type 
            of digital transmission and a method of encoding digital data on multiple carrier frequencies. 
            Because of its ability to encode data on multiple carrier frequencies it has developed into a 
            popular scheme for wideband digital communication. The uses for OFDM are in applications such as 
            digital television and audio broadcasting, also DSL internet access, wireless networks, power line 
            networks, and 4G/5G mobile communications.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color:#000000;">The main advantage of OFDM over single- carrier schemes is its ability to cope with severe 
            channel conditions without having to deal with complex equalization filters. The reason OFDM 
            doesn't need channel equalization is because OFDM is viewed as using many slow modulated narrowband 
            signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal like the single carrier schemes. This 
            mechanism allows for transmitters  to send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency which 
            stops interference that would normally occur when using a single-carrier system.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title is-4">Types of satellite jamming and interference</h2>
            <p>There are three types of interference: natural, man-made and electrical. Natural interference 
                is mainly caused by harsh climate and special astronomical phenomena. Some examples of natural 
                interference are rainstorms, billizards, and thunder; these cause physical damage to the ground 
                station, though the climatic noise is the main cause of interference. Man-made interference refers 
                to mistaken spatial layout and channel allocation. Electrical interference is covered below when 
                talking about different types of jamming.
            </p>
            <p>There are two main types of satellite jamming. The first, uplink jamming, interferes with the signal 
                going from a ground station or user terminal to the satellite. An RF signal of the same frequency as 
                the targeted uplink signal is transmitted to the satellite, aiming to limit the satellite transponder 
                from differentiating between the jamming signal and the actual signal. The second type, downlink jamming, 
                disrupts transmissions sent from the satellite to ground-based or airborne receivers using RF signals that 
                mimic the frequency of the downlink signal. It aims to inhibit ground users from receiving transmissions 
                from the satellite and only needs to be as strong as the signal being received on the ground. Uplink jamming 
                is considered more difficult because greater transmitter power is required to reach a given satellite’s 
                transponders. It could be more impactful, however, due to its ability to degrade the satellite’s signal for all 
                its users. Because downlink jammers must be within the field of view of the receiving terminal’s antenna, 
                however, the effects of downlink jamming are more localized.

            <h2 class="title is-4">Why do we care?</h2>
            <p>Satellite jamming can cause many issues from stopping the flow of information and data to affecting military 
                efforts by delaying early warning systems. Jamming can disrupt missile warning systems, impede access to GPS, 
                and decrease precision and persistence. This also means it could interrupt one’s ability to collect and transmit 
                data, which would decrease the data’s accuracy and reliability. In war time this can be very dangerous because 
                of how it can affect the allies power to effectively transmit data between the groups. In peace jamming can also 
                be dangerous because of the fact that it can be used to stop everyday transmission of data and at the same time 
                steal that information.</p>

            <h2 class="title is-4">Main Advantage</h2>

            <p>Using OFDM as the main transmission system can already stop any attack that tries to attack by finding the correct 
                frequency to disrupt the signal but since OFDM uses multiple lines with frequencies up into the millions, 
                it would be nearly impossible for the attackers to interfere with the correct wavelengths.</p>

            <h2 class="title is-4">Disadvantages</h2>
            <p>Currently the one main disadvantage to OFDM is its requirement for high peak-to 
                average power ratio. Also the synchronization error can destroy the orthogonality 
                and cause interference. OFDM does not offer any advantages when it comes to natural 
                interference so it would be the same as using a single carrier system.</p>
